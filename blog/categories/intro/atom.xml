<p>On their way to exploring the red planet, NASA set another record: It produced the lightest vehicle in all of history.</p>

<p>Curisity's weight creapt below .01 oz before landing on the fourth rock from the sun. For comparison, the the average racing bike weighs more than 240oz.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>NASA still has one last hurdle to climb: Curiosity is still heavier than most forms of transportation if changes in the force of gravity are accounted for. On the ground, Curiosity weighed just north of 8,000 pounds</p>

<h1>Rediculous</h1>

<p>I, like most economists, have been amused by the recent bout of
headlines claiming Apple is now the most valuable company of all time;
in nominal dollars, of course.
I chose a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/20/technology/apple-most-valuable-company/">CNN Money article</a>
as the basis for the above parody. I should note that I had my choice
of articles from many reputable news agencies so CNN is not the only
culpret.
A report that Apple has surpassed Microsoft's 1999 valuation in nominal
terms is just as pointless as the comparison offered above. While it
does make for a catchy headline, the writer of the article continues on
for several paragraphs before guiltily admitting the caveat.</p>

<h1>What's the difference?</h1>

<p>I realize that many are not familiar with the distinction between real
and nominal terms.</p>

<p>We commonly use dollars as a yardstick to compare value.
One can reasonably argue that the most valuable of two items is the one that the market will pay the highest price for.
However, this comparison breaks down over time.</p>

<p>Lets define the value of a dollar to be total GDP divided by the amount of dollars in the market.
Thus, each dollar is a voucher for ownership of some portion of the goods produced by the contry, as measured by GDP.
This is much the same way that a share is a voucher for some portion of ownership of a company.
Now if GDP were to increase between years, the value per dollar would increase as a result; just as the value of a share of a business increases with the business's worth.
Alternatively, if the government were to print more dollars, the value per dollar would decrease.
The value/dollar changes in each of these scenarios and, as a result, the dollar value of a company will also change. This is the nominal value of a company.
The value of a company stays constant if the government prints a load of fresh bills overnight, but the nominal value of the business will change.
Because of this flaw, comparisons of value across time are done in 'real' terms.
This is a nominal value that is adjusted for changes in GDP and the money supply, among other factors.</p>

<p>Let's compare this to the above parody of the CNN article.
Generally, we can compare the mass of two objects by measuring their weight.
However, this comparison breaks down if we take the measurement at different locations.
As we increase our elevation, gravity's effect on the mass of an object decreases, decreasing the weight.
Therefore the weight of a 4kg bowling ball is different at sea level, at the top of mt. everest, and is weightless in space.
A comparison of the weight of the Curiosity Mars rover in space to a bicycle on the ground makes little sense.
Because the objects are far apart, it would be more logical to use a measure that is not affected by distance from the earth just as it makes more sense to compare economic values from different time periods by a metric that does not vary over time.</p>
