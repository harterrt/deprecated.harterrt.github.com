I am an energy market consultant, technology hobbyist, and data junkie trained in financial engineering, math and economics.
This is a collection of notes and articles that I've found interesting. 
This project is primarily an exercise to develop my writing and practice explaining technical material. 
However, if you find something interesting be sure to leave a comment!

This is a work in progress and will be for some time.
